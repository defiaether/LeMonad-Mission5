# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

```

globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*

# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
rule: Create new pages in separate folders
description: |
  Whenever the user asks to create a new page (e.g. "create a profile page", "add a Notifications page", etc),
  create a new folder inside `src/pages/` with the lowercase name of the page,
  and place all related files (component, CSS, test) inside that folder.

steps:
  - Detect page creation intent (phrases like "create a X page", "make a page for Y", etc)
  - Convert page name to lowercase and make a folder: `src/pages/{page-name}/`
  - Inside the folder, create:
      - `{PageName}.jsx` for the main component
      - `{PageName}.css` or `.module.css` for styles
      - Optionally `{PageName}.test.js` if tests are needed
  - Export the page component for routing use

examples:
  - input: "Create a Profile page with a header and a user avatar"
    output:
      src/pages/profile/
        ├── Profile.jsx
        ├── Profile.css
  - input: "Add a Notifications page that shows alerts"
    output:
      src/pages/notifications/
        ├── Notifications.jsx
        ├── Notifications.css
