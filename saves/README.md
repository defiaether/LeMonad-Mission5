## Backup Process

### After Each Phase Completion:

1. **Create Phase Folder**: `mkdir saves/phase-X-description`
2. **Copy Project Files**: Copy all project files to the phase folder
3. **Update Status**: Mark phase as completed in ROADMAP.md
4. **Document Changes**: Create a summary of what was completed
5. **Test Backup**: Verify backup is complete and functional

### Backup Commands:

```bash
# Example for Phase 0 completion
mkdir saves/phase-0-ui-ux-design
xcopy . saves/phase-0-ui-ux-design /E /I /H /Y
```

### What Gets Backed Up:

- ✅ All source code files
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Dependencies (package.json, etc.)
- ✅ Database schemas
- ✅ Smart contracts
- ✅ Design files
- ✅ Test files

### What Gets Excluded:

- ❌ node_modules/ (can be reinstalled)
- ❌ .git/ (version control)
- ❌ build/ (generated files)
- ❌ .env files (sensitive data)
- ❌ Log files

## Recovery Process

If project interruption occurs:

1. **Identify Last Stable Phase**: Check which phase was last completed
2. **Restore from Backup**: Copy files from `saves/phase-X-description/`
3. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or equivalent
4. **Verify Functionality**: Test that everything works
5. **Continue Development**: Resume from the next phase
