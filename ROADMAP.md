## Backup System

### Automated Backup Process
After each phase completion, use the backup script to preserve project progress:

```powershell
# Example: Backup Phase 0
.\backup-phase.ps1 -PhaseNumber 0 -PhaseName "ui-ux-design" -Description "UI/UX design completed"

# Example: Backup Phase 1
.\backup-phase.ps1 -PhaseNumber 1 -PhaseName "foundation" -Description "Foundation and architecture completed"
```

### Recovery Process
If project interruption occurs, restore from the last completed phase:

```powershell
# Example: Restore from Phase 0
.\restore-phase.ps1 -PhaseNumber 0 -PhaseName "ui-ux-design"
```

### Backup Locations
- **Backup Folder**: `saves/`
- **Documentation**: `saves/README.md`
- **Backup Script**: `backup-phase.ps1`
- **Restore Script**: `restore-phase.ps1`
